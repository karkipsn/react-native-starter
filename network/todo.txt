Custom hook to perform every api calls  with axios API

- WIll have Request type and Response type as Generic Type and will have params as an input.


-  Uses case:

Ui will have customm hook such as useState hook or just like setState callback muust have 
api calling callback which sets up the state/response with return type of data, onSuccess or 
onError Object.


steps 1:

- Config for Axios (Might be the custom configuration accordingly to the pages
(register and login may not have token)).(As a config or instance set up page.)


- one generic function/ hook to call every api.

- Service will call that function with Input Type, output type and 
config(consits of baseUrl, params, headers).


UI will have reducer hook likewise state hook which updates UI as well as does the 
computational work and returns the formatted promise(mapped response) with the response/ or of error type.


So,
let {state, apicallFunction} = useNetworkReducer(config)

apicallFunction(service with generic parmas of Input and Output.)
